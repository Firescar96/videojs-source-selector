* Removes some broken functionality to prioritize a working implementation

[The repository](https://github.com/jfujita/videojs-http-source-selector) this is forked from is solidly in the unmaintained category. There's some things to keep like the tests and demo, some things to replace like karma with jest, and some things to delete like broken functionality. I'll work on it.
